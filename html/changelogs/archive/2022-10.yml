  Wallem:
  - imageadd: Resprites the Fulton Recovery Beacon
  vincentiusvin:
  - rscdel: Removed the broken pressure power multiplier which always evaluates to
      2. Multiplied base SM power production by 2.
  - rscdel: SM will no longer gain power when exposed to space. It actually used to
      do that, but only when the tile it's on has gas so you don't really notice it.
  - qol: added the factor breakdowns to the SM ui.
  - qol: added the gas effect breakdowns to the SM ui.
  - qol: Made the supermatter selection in NT CIMS ui frontend based. Notifications
      will be based on you pressing the bell button instead of opening a SM page.
  - code_imp: Instead of showing the environment breakdown of the SM tile, the NT
      CIMS will show you the exact gas mixture that it uses for calculation.
  - code_imp: Total moles in NT CIMS will now be substituted with absorbed moles,
      which is the thing we use to calculate scrung delams. Scrungs at 1800.
  - balance: Unified the SM taking damage on space (last modified 2018) with SM taking
      damage around space (added 2020, last modified 2022). Chose the latter formula,
      it's significantly stronger.
  - balance: SM will start healing at the same damage at which it stops taking heat
      damage. Instead of the old fixed healing at ~313K.
  - balance: made the low mole heat resistance thing on SM not scale with heat resistant
      gases.
  - balance: Made the supermatter temperature power gain multiplier thing linear at
      1/6 instead of 50/273 or 30/273.
  - balance: Psychologist heat reduction is weaker on high heat gas.
  - refactor: rerouted how external damage (bullets) and external power (emitter)
      is applied to SM.
  - refactor: restructured the internal power calculations for SM. Power should be
      applied on each atmos tick instead of separately.
  - refactor: restructured how the SM calculates the damage that it takes. No changes
      expected except for the low mole temp limit multiplier thing.
  - refactor: Restructured SM pluox generation and miasma consumption. No changes
      expected though.
